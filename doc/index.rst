Product Measurements with Densitiy Module
#########################################

To the previous measurements in the product template for paralelepipedal shape (length, height, width, weight), this module adds:

- Another type of cylindrical shape with the diameter measurement (and the previous length).
- The density with its weight and volume UoMs. From the measurements and the density the weight is automatically computed. Or from the measurements and weight the density is automatically computed.
- UoM default values for the all measurements and density in the product configuration.
- A Python expression to compute the code from measurements, for example [1.0cm x 2.0cm x 3.0cm].
